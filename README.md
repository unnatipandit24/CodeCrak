# CodeCrak

CodeCrak is a **developer-focused mobile application** that helps students and early-career engineers present their **coding profiles, skills, and personality** in one unified platform. The app bridges the gap between **candidates and recruiters** by combining competitive programming stats, and video introductions into a single shareable profile.

## Problem Statement

Recruiters often rely only on resumes, which fail to reflect a candidate’s **actual coding consistency, problem-solving skills, and growth** across platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces. Candidates, on the other hand, struggle to present all their achievements in one place.

**CodeCrak solves this by creating a single, verified developer profile powered by real-time data.**
